<h2> Business Student at The University of Maine </h2>

<p> Hello, my name is Tiffany and I am a sophomore here at <a href="https://umaine.edu">The University of Maine </a>. I am currently majoring in accounting and business management and hope to work towards my masters at some point. Although this is my second year in college, it is my first year at this school. Last year I attended The University of Southern Maine in Portland, and it was just not the school for me. I'm so happy that I made the switch to a larger school. I love how there is always something to do and always new people to meet. All of the different clubs and organizations here also interest me as well. This semester I was sworn into UMaine's Student Government where I will help make decisions and plan events on campus. Since being at UMaine, I have really changed my outlook on life and am thankful for all the opportunities that continue to come my way here.
